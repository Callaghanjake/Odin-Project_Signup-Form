<h1>Odin Project - CSS Sign Up Form</h1>

This Sign Up Form makes use of HTML validation and simple client side Javascript validation to prevent form submission unless all proper criteria are met.

As part of the Odin Project curriculum the form makes use of CSS Grid, HTML form best practices and Javascript. As per the curriculum guidance, this form is not screen-size responsive.

Challenges faced in this project were based around javascript variable placement. Because variables were global, and not linked with the forms submission, they weren't updating with user values. This was a quick fix.

If this project is returned to, mobile responsivness will be the focus.
